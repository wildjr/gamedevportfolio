	<h1>Spacing Out (2019~)</h1>
	<text>Description: Spacing Out is my current project, coming soon to the Play Store. It is still a work in progress, and a lot of the sprites and text are placeholders. The art style I'm aiming for is pencil drawn, with a slightly rough around the edges feel, almost as if it came out of someone's imagination. The concept is that it is a 2D physics based game with puzzle elements where you play as a group of astronauts stranded in space due to an accident. The only way to move in space is by throwing something in the opposite direction, and that forms the core of gameplay. The objective is to get to the 'safe zone' where you can be rescued by your colleagues.</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Solo programmer and artist<br>&bull; Created, and will be creating, everything from scratch for this game<br>&bull; Creation of an introductory cutscene<br>&bull; Scripting various objects and their varying behaviours<br>&bull; Created animations for cutscenes and astronauts</text><br>

	<h1>Winter Tower Defense (2018)</h1>
	<text>Description: Winter Tower Defense is a first person shooter game created in Unreal Engine for an assignment</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Solo developer<br>&bull; Used blueprints to control the spawn and behaviour of bombs, shooting of snowballs, interactions between snowballs and bombs, score and castle health</text><br>

	<h1>Neurosys (2017-2018)</h1>
	<text>Description: Neurosys was developed in Unity (C#) and was the capstone project for university. The project can be broken down into a simulation (Unity C# for Samsung Gear VR) and app development. The simulation side of the project, showcased here, was developed by a team of two. The idea was that this simulation could potentially be used (in the presence of a licensed therapist) to aid in the treatment of Acrophobia (fear of heights) and Arachnophobia (fear of spiders). The project won third place in the UOWD Innovation Fair</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Co-lead developer for the simulation<br>&bull; 3D modelled most objects in the Acrophobia scenes<br>&bull; Helped with level designs across the board<br>&bull; Design implemention for the Acrophobia levels<br>&bull; All Acrophobia scripts<br>&bull; Terrain sculpting<br>&bull; UI implementation+controls</text><br>

	<h1>Scroodle (2017)</h1>
	<text>Description: Scroodle is a proof of concept of an asymmetrical co-operative multiplayer 2D game with platforming elements. The two players are Blobby and The Hand. The Hand needs to keep Blobby alive and get it to the end of the level, while Blobby contributes by collecting resources for The Hand to use.</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Solo developer<br>&bull; Wrote all scripts, created animation paths, prefabs, etc<br>&bull; Note: The sprites were the only thing not created by me, as they were imported from a Unity asset package</text><br>

	<h1>When The Wolfsbane Blooms (2017)</h1>
	<text>Description: WTWB is a 2.5D platformer which was developed for a university assignment by a team of two in Unity (C#). The models and animations are from Mixamo, as the assignment was testing game scripting rather than animation or modelling. Please note that this project was created under a time crunch, and is more of a tech demo than an actual game. The game follows Lyra, a girl who has the gift (or curse) of transforming into a beast when under direct moonlight</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Co-Lead Game Programmer<br>&bull; Worked on some aspects of the the beast and Lyra's movements (especially wall climbing)<br>&bull; Used finite state machines for enemies, plus to decide how NPCs (civilian and otherwise) react to the beast.<br>&bull; Contributed to level design<br>&bull; Programmed the UI display, especially notable in the last few screenshots</text><br>

	<h1>Hue Man (2016)</h1>
	<text>Description: Hue Man is a 2D side scrolling game created in Unity for Android phones. The objective is for the superhero, Hue Man, to collect orbs. Hue Man can change his colour by using the buttons at the bottom, and can only collect an orb if he matches the colour of the orb. Successfully collecting an orb gives +1 score and +3 seconds, but collecting an orb of the wrong colour gives -2 seconds. The game speeds up as time goes on, and is over when time runs out</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Lead designer and art director<br>&bull; Helped in the design of the game and mechanics<br>&bull; Helped to find the general feel of the art style<br>&bull; Created sprites</text><br><br>

	<h1>Pokémon: Battle Arena (2014)</h1>
	<text>Description: PBA is a fan-made tribute to the Pokémon series made in C++. Players are thrown into a room with 4 other trainers and must defeat them all in order to win. Each battle consists of 3 rounds, with randomly selected Pokémon on either side.</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Lead programmer<br>&bull; Worked on every aspect of the game except graphics<br>&bull; Involved high complexity class and object design (IVs, EVs, stats), as well as high complexity programming<br>&bull; Implementation of numerous functions for the battle system (including complex attacks)</text><br>
