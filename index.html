	<h1>Spacing Out (2019~)</h1>
	<text>Description: Spacing Out is my current project, coming soon to the Play Store. It is still a work in progress, and a lot of the sprites and text are placeholders. The art style I'm aiming for is pencil drawn, with a slightly rough around the edges feel, almost as if it came out of someone's imagination. The concept is that it is a 2D physics based game with puzzle elements created in Unity (C#) where you play as a group of astronauts stranded in space due to an accident. The only way to move in space is by throwing something in the opposite direction, and that forms the core of gameplay. The objective is to get to the 'safe zone' where you can be rescued by your colleagues.</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Solo programmer and artist<br>&bull; Created, and will be creating, all assets, scripts and prefabs for this game<br>&bull; Creation of an introductory cutscene using animations and scripts<br>&bull; Scripting various objects and their behaviours, such as:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; Balls: The basic throwable object. An astronaut can throw it to fly in the opposite direction<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; Fire extinguishers: Give a more continuous movement. Can be used to round tight corners without having to use 3 balls, for example<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; O2 canister: Can create a controlled explosion to break weak walls<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; Wormholes: A feature in some levels which teleports the player to another wormhole<br>&bull; Created animations for cutscenes and astronauts</text><br><br>

	<h1>Neurosys (2017-2018)</h1>
	<text>Description: Neurosys was the capstone project for university. The project can be broken down into a simulation (Unity C# for Samsung Gear VR) and app development. The simulation side of the project, showcased here, was developed by a team of two. The idea was that this simulation could potentially be used (in the presence of a licensed therapist) to aid in the treatment of Acrophobia (fear of heights) and Arachnophobia (fear of spiders). The project won third place in the UOWD Innovation Fair.</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Co-lead developer for the simulation<br>&bull; 3D modelled most objects in the Acrophobia scenes using Autodesk Maya including<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; Staircase<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; Door<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; Table<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; Chair<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9643; TV<br>&bull; Helped with level planning and design across the board, including setting parameters for how intense each level needs to be, variables that the therapist can control within each level, locations of objects and hazards in the levels, etc<br>&bull; Design implemention for the Acrophobia levels<br>&bull; All Acrophobia scripts including hot-air balloon and elevator controls<br>&bull; Terrain sculpting using Unity's terrain toolds<br>&bull; UI implementation+controls</text><br><br>

	<h1>When The Wolfsbane Blooms (2017)</h1>
	<text>Description: WTWB is a 2.5D platformer which was developed for a university assignment by a team of two in Unity (C#) for Windows. The models and animations are from Mixamo, as the assignment was testing game scripting rather than animation or modelling. The game follows Lyra, a girl who has the gift (or curse) of transforming into a beast when under direct moonlight</text><br><br>
	<text>My Role: <br>&bull; Game Programmer<br>&bull; Worked on some aspects of the the beast and Lyra's movements (especially wall climbing) using a combination of Unity's triggers and colliders<br>&bull; Used finite state machines for enemies, plus used FSMs to decide how NPCs (civilian and otherwise) react to the beast.<br>&bull; Contributed to level design<br>&bull; Programmed the UI display, especially notable in the last few screenshots, including the health bar's changing colours and switching the player icon when transforming between Lyra and the beast</text><br><br>

	<h1>Hue Man (2016)</h1>
	<text>Description: Hue Man is a 2D side scrolling game created in Unity for Android phones. The objective is for the superhero, Hue Man, to collect orbs. Hue Man can change his colour by using the buttons at the bottom, and can only collect an orb if he matches the colour of the orb. Successfully collecting an orb gives +1 score and +3 seconds, but collecting an orb of the wrong colour gives -2 seconds. The game speeds up as time goes on, and is over when time runs out</text><br><br>
