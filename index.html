	<h1>Spacing Out (2019~)</h1>
	<text>Description: Spacing Out is my current project, coming soon to the Play Store. It is still a work in progress, and a lot of the sprites and text are placeholders. The art style I'm aiming for is pencil drawn, with a slightly rough around the edges feel, almost as if it came out of someone's imagination. The concept is that it is a 2D physics based game with puzzle elements where you play as a group of astronauts stranded in space due to an accident. The only way to move in space is by throwing something in the opposite direction, and that forms the core of gameplay. The objective is to get to the 'safe zone' where you can then be rescued by your colleagues.</text><br>

	<h1>Winter Tower Defense (2018)</h1>
	<text>Description: Winter Tower Defense is a first person shooter game created in Unreal Engine (using blueprints) for an assignment</text><br>

	<h1>Neurosys (2017-2018)</h1>
	<text>Description: Neurosys was developed in Unity (C#) and was the capstone project for university. The project can be broken down into a simulation (Unity C# for Samsung Gear VR) and app development. The simulation side of the project, showcased here, was developed by a team of two. The idea was that this simulation could potentially be used (in the presence of a licensed therapist) to aid in the treatment of Acrophobia (fear of heights) and Arachnophobia (fear of spiders). The project won third place in the UOWD Innovation Fair</text><br>
	<text>My Role: As one of two developers on the Unity side, my tasks were mostly related to the Acrophobia levels. This involved 3D modelling most objects in the scenes, helping with level designs (for both sets of levels) and then implementing those designs for the Acrophobia levels, all Acro scripts, terrain sculpting, and UI implementation+controls</text><br>

	<h1>Scroodle (2017)</h1>
	<text>Description: Scroodle is a proof of concept of an asymmetrical co-operative multiplayer 2D game with platforming elements. The two players are Blobby and The Hand. The Hand needs to keep Blobby alive and get it to the end of the level, while Blobby contributes by collecting resources for The Hand to use.</text><br>
	<text>My Role: Although the design was done by a team of 3, I was the sole developer. All scripts, animation paths, prefabs, etc were made by me. The sprites were the only thing not created, as they were imported from a Unity asset package</text><br>

	<h1>When The Wolfsbane Blooms (2017)</h1>
	<text>Description: WTWB is a 2.5D platformer which was developed for a university assignment by a team of two in Unity (C#). The models and animations are from Mixamo, as the assignment was testing game scripting rather than animation or modelling. Please note that this project was created under a time crunch, and is more of a tech demo than an actual game. The game follows Lyra, a girl who has the gift (or curse) of transforming into a beast when under direct moonlight</text>
	<text>My Role: As Game Programmer, I worked on some aspects of the the beast and Lyra (especially wall climbing), NPC AI (using Finite State Machines to decide how an NPC reacts, etc) and enemies. I also contributed to level design and UI</text><br>

	<h1>Hue Man (2016)</h1>
	<text>Description: Hue Man is a 2D side scrolling game created in Unity for Android phones. The objective is for the superhero, Hue Man, to collect orbs. Hue Man can change his colour by using the buttons at the bottom, and can only collect an orb if he matches the colour of the orb. Successfully collecting an orb gives +1 score and +3 seconds, but collecting an orb of the wrong colour gives -2 seconds. The game speeds up as time goes on, and is over when time runs out</text>
	<text>My Role: Unlike the other games on this portfolio, my role in this game was more as a designer than as a programmer. I helped in the design of the game and mechanics, as well as helping to find the general feel of the art style, and then creating sprites</text><br><br>

	<h1>Pokémon: Battle Arena (2014)</h1>
	<text>Description: PBA is a fan-made tribute to the Pokémon series made in C++. Players are thrown into a room with 4 other trainers and must defeat them all in order to win. Each battle consists of 3 rounds, with randomly selected Pokémon on either side.</text>
	<text>My Role: I was lead programmer on everything except graphics. As anyone that has played a Pokémon game can attest to, this involved high complexity class and object design, and numerous functions that needed to be implemented</text><br>
